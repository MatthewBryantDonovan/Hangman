<!-- 1. [Watch the demo](https://youtu.be/W-IJcC4tYFI).

2. Choose a theme for your game! In the demo, 
we picked an 80s theme: 80s questions, 
80s sound and an 80s aesthetic. You can
 choose any subject for your theme, though, so be creative!

9. After the user wins/loses the game 
should automatically choose another word and 
make the user play it. -->


<!-- 
##### Word Guess Game Bonuses

1. Play a sound or song when the user guesses their
 word correctly, like in our demo.

2. Write some stylish CSS rules to make a 
design that fits your game's theme.

3. **HARD MODE:** Organize your game code 
as an object, except for the key events to 
get the letter guessed. This will be a challenge if you haven't coded 
with JavaScript before, but we encourage anyone already 
familiar with the language to try this out.

4. Save your whole game and its properties 
in an object.

5. Save any of your game's functions as methods,
 and call them underneath your object declaration 
 using event listeners.

6. Don't forget to place your global variables
 and functions above your object.
   * Remember: global variables, then objects, then calls.
